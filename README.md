# create
Website to create new iso images. You can try it out here at [codersos.github.io/create](https://codersos.github.io/create/).

## Development

This website uses [Jekyll][jekyll] to build the page.
You first need to [install Jekyll][install-jekyll].
When the installation is done:

1. Open the command line
   - Windows: type cmd into the start menu
   - Ubuntu: Press control+alt+t
2. Go to this repository with the cd command
   `cd create`
3. Serve the website
   `jekyll serve --trace`
4. Open http://localhost:4000

## Useful things to know when developing

There are folders with `_` in the beginning.
They will not be shown on the site.
They have special meaning to jekyll.

- `_data` is where we can list all commands and servers for this website.
